# What does this program do?

This program will **take a number of decimal numbers** (determined by the user) and *round them* to the nearst whole number

## Things to Keep in Mind

1. This program only takes into account the first decimal value of a given number. Thus, if one enters decimal number 283.4653 the program will convert it to simply 283.4 and then round it to the nearest whole number. 
2. If one enters a whole number the program will make it a decime by adding a (.0).
